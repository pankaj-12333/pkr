    <h1> ISKON &nbsp; Juhu <h2><br> (mumbai) </h2></h1>
    <p><!--actualy this code is besed upon me--><b><hr size="10" noshade> to acquaint all people of world with universal <br>
     principles of self-realization and God consciousness so that they may derive the highest benefit of spiritual understanding, unity and peace. The Vedic literature recommend
        
        
       <em><strong> These teachings are received through the preceptorial line known as the Brahma-Madhav-Gaudiya Vaishnava
         sampradaya. ISKCON is part of the disciplic succession which started with Lord Krishna Himself and continued
          with Srila Vyasadeva, Srila Madhavacharya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and in the present day His Divine Grace 
          A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and his followers. </strong> </em>
        
        ISKCON‚Äôs teachings are non-sectarian, following the principle <br> of sanatana dharma or eternal
         religion, which denotes the eternal <br> activity of all living beings ‚Äì loving devotional service
          (bhakti-yoga) to Supreme Personality of Godhead. <br>
        
        History of the Hare Krishna Movement
        In 1965, at the age of 69, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada <br> boarded the steamship ‚ÄòJaladuta‚Äô from
         Mumbai on his way to United States. At an age when most <br> people think of retiring Srila Prabhupada undertook this 
         arduous journey to fulfill the mission of Lord Caitanya and follow the instruction of his spiritual
          master Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur to carry the message of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam to Western world.
        
        After arriving in New York City in September 1965,<br><br><br> &nbsp; rila Prabhupada struggled alone for 
        the first year to establish his Krishna conscious movement. He lived simply, lectured whenever and
         wherever he got the opportunity and gradually began to attract some small interest in his teaching. In 
         July of 1966, while still working from an obscure storefront on New York City‚Äôs Lower East Side, Srila
          Prabhupada nonetheless founded a spiritual society intended for worldwide participation. He called it 
          International Society for Krishna Consciousness or ISKCON for short and thus began the Hare Krishna movement in America.
        
        At the time of incorporation, Srila Prabhupada had not attracted <br> even one committed follower. 
        Undeterred, he enlisted volunteers from among the small group of regular attendees at his evenin <br>
         lectures to act as ISKCON‚Äôs first trustees. That was then. Today, ISKCON comprises of more than 400 temples
          worldwide, 40 rural communities and over 100 vegetarian restaurants. It also conducts special projects 
          throughout the world, such as ‚ÄúFood for Life‚Äù, the only free vegetarian relief program in the world.
